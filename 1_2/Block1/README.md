A simple Turn and Text Based RPG core gameplay made in java.

To run the jar file:(Tested with JDK 19) 

java -jar /Block1/RPG_TT.jar

-The game played with keyboard number inputs.
-The game is not bug proof, giving it a wrong input will cause crash. 

Running as an executable doesn't work.. cause..Java hates humanity.
Likely because Java wants you to define the project as a Console app.
